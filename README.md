# Django-Docker template

## Template source
This template was created following the instructions set on Michael Herman's [tutorial](https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-django-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx/#nginx). 
It provided useful insight on the how's and why's of many of the features used here.

This template is created as general as possible, to be used on the future for as many projects as we like and save precious time developing a foundation. Instead, we can put this time to a much more useful purpose, such as developing a solution.


Right at this point (2022-08-27), the thing that is missing is static files management. That will be configured by using the `whitenoise` library as suggested by the book *Django for beginners* (by author  William S. Vincent).

This is still a work in progress.
